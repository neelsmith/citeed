#citeed #

Project to build a portable, virtualized CITE editing environment.

Initially experimenting with [Vagrant][1], which you need to use this project.

Provisioning in the current Vagrantfile assumes you have a box named `precise32` locally available, which I downloaded with 

    vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
